          From Spotify API, Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements
          including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
      - name: acousticness

      - name: energy
        description: |
          Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. 
          Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
      - name: valence
        description: |
          A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive
          (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
